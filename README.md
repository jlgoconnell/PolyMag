# PylyhedralMagnet

This project is an implementation of my PhD work on interactions between permanent magnets. At the moment it's only just starting, but I hope to build it out to include a range of features.

## What's it do?

Right now, not much. I'm just starting it out so the next steps are to add magnetic field calculations for cuboidal and polyhedral magnets.

## What is planned?

- [ ] Magnetic field calculation for unity relative permeability
    - [ ] Cuboidal magnets
    - [ ] Polyhedral magnets
    - [ ] Extension: Cylindrical and ring magnets
- [ ] Magnetic force estimations
- [ ] Magnetic torque estimations
